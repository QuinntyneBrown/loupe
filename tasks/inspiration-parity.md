# Inspiration mock parity

Branch: `feat/inspiration-mock-parity`. Approved scope includes all destination
pages and live provider validation. Mocks are authoritative; the original video
is historical evidence, not the target. Complete one acceptance case at a time:
Given–When–Then, expected RED, implementation, GREEN, regressions, commit.

## Delivery checklist

- [ ] Reference cards: title/attribution overlay, safe source, named placeholders,
      board actions, keyboard/touch, image proportions and grid.
- [ ] Boards: create, rename, delete, counts, list, memberships, remove/Undo,
      alphabetical picker with inline creation, board view and empty state.
- [ ] Collection: header totals, sidebar, tags/More tags/mobile dialog, clear,
      URL state, pagination, loading, errors, empty and empty-filtered states.
- [ ] Unified save: link/upload, draft import, preview/edit, boards, cancel,
      duplicate, fallback link/image/notes, progress, retry and atomic commit.
- [ ] Reference: full image, metadata/notes, image replacement, deletion,
      photographer link, board picker, suggestions/review/manual tags, related.
- [ ] Photographers: collection/detail, draft page read, editable preview,
      duplicates, fallback, edit/delete/link references, summary states.
- [ ] Search: keyword/meaning, examples, type/boards/tags, URL state,
      complete paginated results and all loading/empty/error states.
- [ ] Navigation: four areas, bottom tabs, slash shortcut, Settings and sign-out.
- [ ] Durable workers: real imports, visual suggestions, grounded summaries,
      local embeddings, indexing generations, retries, stale-result protection.
- [ ] Independent design-system examples/tokens and mirrored frontend tokens.
- [ ] Visual comparison of every mock state, dialogs and breakpoint boundaries.
- [ ] API integration/Chromium acceptance, accessibility and regressions.
- [ ] Live validation with permitted fixtures and existing Azure configuration.
- [ ] Updated demo/evidence, final review, push and PR against main.

## Acceptance additions (L2-012, L2-043, L2-044)

1. Given an owned image reference with attribution and source, when the collection
   is read, then the card receives that attribution and source without a detail
   request; another owner's metadata is never returned.
2. Given that card, when hovered or keyboard-focused, then its title and supplied
   attribution appear together with an Open source page action; activating the
   source opens the saved URL without opener access or a private referrer.
3. Given no attribution/source or preview, when browsed, then the card identifies
   unknown attribution and missing imagery and has no fabricated source link.

## Evidence

Record commands and observed RED/GREEN results here as slices complete. Live
Azure configuration was not found in the planning shell; its availability must
be established without printing credentials. Live quality checks are mandatory.

### Card source and attribution
- RED: API card test failed because `attribution` was absent; both Chromium card
  scenarios failed because the supplied/unknown attribution was absent.
- GREEN: all 7 ListReferences API tests and all 13 Inspiration Chromium tests passed.
- Production Angular build passed (existing initial-bundle warning remains).
- Isolated Chromium screenshot inspected: title/attribution overlay and source
  control render correctly. Collection/header/navigation work remains outstanding.
