# Acceptance evidence

Record the command, observed red failure, green result, and review for each slice.
No application behavior was implemented before this log was created.

## DS-01: independent keyboard-operable button

- Red: `cd design-system; npm test -- --project=chromium` served the built blank
  page successfully, then failed because the reference heading was absent.
- Includes part of L2-051.1/.3 and L2-045.1; these whole criteria remain open until
  all their examples and workflows are delivered.
- Green: `npm test` built the static site and passed all 3 browser tests. Desktop (1440) and mobile (375) screenshots inspected; no clipped content. Review: native keyboard button behavior, inert synthetic content, token-based authored styles, no runtime service calls. No full accessibility conformance claim.

## DS-02: navigable token reference

- Red: focused Chromium token test failed on missing Tokens navigation.
- Green: npm test passed 48 checks across Chromium/Firefox/WebKit, including 14 viewport sizes per engine, axe A/AA scans, no external requests, and no runtime exceptions. Reviewed inert DOM construction and direct use of authoritative values. Typography/motion specimen refinements remain part of the gallery slice.

## DS-03: editor dialog

- Red: focused Chromium test failed because the editor trigger was absent.
- First implementation exposed focus escape in Chromium/WebKit; retained assertions and added explicit Tab wrapping.
- Green: npm test passed 60 browser checks, including modal keyboard containment, error accessibility scans, save/cancel focus recovery and the full token viewport regression. Build passed within the test command.
